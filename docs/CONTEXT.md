# Documentation Structure

Quick navigation for simplifytoglorify docs. Each section is self-contained and follows a logical flow.

## Main Sections

1. **[Business](./business/CONTEXT.md)** — Products, audience, sales workflows, content strategy
2. **[Tech](./tech/CONTEXT.md)** — Architecture, code structure, development setup
3. **[Operations](./operations/CONTEXT.md)** — Admin tasks, deployment, monitoring, troubleshooting
4. **[Reference](./reference/CONTEXT.md)** — Environment variables, routes, commands, file inventory

## First Time Here?

1. Read `CLAUDE.md` in project root (quick overview & project guidelines)
2. Skim this file (you're here now)
3. Go to the section you need → read its CONTEXT.md
4. Jump to specific files as needed
